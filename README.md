# Data

All [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics/data) was proivded by the World Bank. The Health Nutrition and Population Statistics database provides critical data on health, nutrition, and population metrics, gathered from a range of international sources. This comprehensive database encompasses various themes, including population dynamics, nutrition, reproductive health, health financing, medical resources and usage, immunization, infectious diseases, and HIV/AIDS. It also includes metrics such as DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) and population projections. Furthermore, the database offers insights into lending practices related to health initiatives.
 
 In addition to general statistics, the Health Nutrition and Population Statistics database features detailed analyses categorized by wealth quintiles, enabling a deeper understanding of health disparities and economic influences on health outcomes. This valuable resource supports research and policy-making by providing accessible and reliable data on global health trends and issues.

# Exploratory data analysis

clearly see a decline in birthrate while deathrate was similar. Japan deathrate climbs higher than thier birthrate towards the end of the timeline.

Main point here is that Canada has seen a steady decline in the adolescent birthrate over the years. This correlates with the decline in birthrate.

Overall, we see a steady climb in life expectancy for both countries. Perhaps worth noting that males are consistenly below the female average! This does correlate with the decline in birthrate. As life expectancy increases we see perhaps a lesser need for having more children.

This graph is in line with the previous graph. We see the likelihood of surving until 65 continues to grow.

This final chart complements the previous by showing the female life expectancy in a scatter plot.

Extra charts to explore. We ran out of time to explain in detail.

Conclusion:

Overall, as countries increase in life expectancy we see a lowering of birth rate. 
We probably needed more time to pull more data together in a meaninfull way.
